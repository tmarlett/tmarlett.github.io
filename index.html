              Hi, I'm Tim! You might be wondering why I called you here, but that is not important to our plot. What is important is all of this
              information on penguins I'm about to give you. Did you know that the penguin you see here is from South Africa? Not many people know 
              that South Africa has penguins. They have black feet and only get about a foot and a half tall, making them some of the tiniest penguins 
              in the world. Because of this small size, you can probably fit a lot of them into a TSA approved luggage container and sneak them into the
              United States, and to my place, where I will keep these penguins as pets. Please. I'm begging you.
